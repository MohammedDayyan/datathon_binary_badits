===============================================================================

Slide 5: Core Algorithm - Dark Channel Prior
===============================================================================
🔬 DARK CHANNEL PRIOR ALGORITHM

Mathematical Foundation:
J(x) = (I(x) - A) / max(t(x), t₀) + A

Where:
• J(x) = Recovered scene radiance (dehazed image)
• I(x) = Observed hazy image
• A = Atmospheric light
• t(x) = Transmission map
• t₀ = Minimum transmission threshold

Implementation Steps:
1. Compute dark channel: J_dark(x) = min_c(min_y(J(y)))
2. Estimate atmospheric light from brightest dark pixels
3. Calculate transmission map using normalized image
4. Refine transmission with guided filtering
5. Recover scene radiance using atmospheric model

Optimizations:
• OpenCV erosion for efficient dark channel computation
• Guided filtering for smooth transmission maps
• Adaptive thresholding for noise reduction
===============================================================================

Slide 5: Guided Filtering Implementation
===============================================================================
🎯 GUIDED FILTER TRANSMISSION REFINEMENT

Purpose:
• Smooth transmission maps while preserving edges
• Reduce artifacts and noise in dehazed results
• Maintain depth information in the image

Algorithm:
a = cov(I, p) / (var(I) + ε)
b = mean(p) - a * mean(I)
q = a * I + b

Where:
• I = Guidance image (grayscale)
• p = Transmission map
• q = Refined transmission
• ε = Regularization parameter

Benefits:
✅ Edge-preserving smoothing

✅ Artifact reduction
✅ Better depth preservation

Slide 7: Quality Metrics
===============================================================================
📈 IMAGE QUALITY ASSESSMENT

Calculated Metrics:

1. PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)
   - Measures overall image quality
   - Higher values indicate better quality
   - Formula: 20 * log₁₀(MAX_I / √MSE)

2. SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)
   - Assesses perceived image quality
   - Considers luminance, contrast, structure
   - Range: -1 to 1 (higher is better)

3. MSE (Mean Squared Error)
   - Measures average squared differences
   - Lower values indicate less distortion
   - Formula: (1/mn) * Σ[I(i,j) - K(i,j)]²

4. Detail Preservation
   - Edge preservation assessment
   - Uses Sobel edge detection
   - Correlation-based scoring
